 2.2 Project Scope
The application will provide with exercise routines which will cover exercises for all body types and muscles and will tell the number of reps or exercises suitable for your body type.
The application will provide with diet plans based on your health concerns to help and normalize your eating routines. There will be a number of diet plans to help you choose based on your preferences.

 2.3 Existing Work
Our application will cover both workout and dietary routines. In previous applications, these two routines were seperated and not brought together however our application is dependent on both routines and will provide the most efficient health plan.
