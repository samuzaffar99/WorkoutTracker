Problem Statement:
The project is titled “Workout Tracker” which is a mobile based application aimed to deliver a routine for a better and healthy lifestyle based on an individual’s health requirements. It includes a personalized dietary and workout plan which will enable the users to choose a balanced routine to meet their desired health status. 
No product has been released that emphasized on diet and workout simultaneously customized to every individual’s body configuration and desired outcome. The time required to execute this project is roughly a month or two. Since this application-based project requires both front end and back end development, a dependency is there to coordinate them both and hence the final product will be the result of the productivity achieved from both of them.
This will benefit people who are trying to optimize their health and fitness, either in the gym, at home or the kitchen, to reach a target goal that may take weeks, month or even years. It provides a suitable plan on a weekly template. It encourages people to care for their health, by making the process easier, and fills a market niche.
